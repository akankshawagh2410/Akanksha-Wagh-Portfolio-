## 🎓 Data Scientist | AI + Analytics Enthusiast | GenAI Explorer


### 🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m Akanksha—a data scientist by degree, a GenAI explorer by passion, and a curious human always chasing “what’s next.” By day, I’m building chatbots, decoding customer sentiment, and optimizing campaigns. But when I’m not wrangling code or plotting forecasts, you’ll probably find me editing videos, exploring new sports, writing blog posts about life, or hunting down new places to eat.
